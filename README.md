# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python on Spotify-YouTube Dataset

## Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information from both Spotify and YouTube. The goal is to uncover insights about music and video trends, user engagement, and content popularity. The analysis aims to understand patterns and correlations between Spotify and YouTube data to draw meaningful conclusions.

## Objectives

### 1. Data Exploration and Cleaning:
- Importing and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Merging data from Spotify and YouTube to create a unified dataset for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyzing key metrics such as song and artist popularity, video engagement and trends.
- Visualizing data trends and patterns using various plotting techniques.
- Identifying correlations between different features in the dataset.

### 3. Key Insights:
#### Spotify Analysis:
- Determined trends in music popularity based on genre, artist, and release date.
- Identified top-performing tracks and artists and their impact on streaming numbers.

#### YouTube Analysis:
- Analyzed video performance metrics such as views, likes, and comments across different categories.
- Discovered popular content creators and their impact on viewer engagement.

#### Combined Insights:
- Explored the relationship between music popularity on Spotify and related video content on YouTube.
- Uncovered patterns in user behavior and engagement across both platforms.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is available on Kaggle. It combines information from Spotify and YouTube, including various CSV files with metrics related to music and video content. You can access and download the dataset from the following link:
- [Spotify-YouTube Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the analysis.
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data manipulation and visualization.

## Getting Started
To reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.
2. Install the required Python libraries if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts provided in the repository to perform data exploration and visualization.
